								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst the Coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, the Judicial Council of California continues to carefully monitor the developing virus outbreak and situations surrounding it. Courts across the nation have been advised to follow the guidance provided by the Department of Public Health, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to slow the spread of the virus. To stay updated on changed information contact <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/">The Ticket Clinic Law Firm</a> at <strong>1-866-248-2846</strong> and talk to our legal team members. Our legal team members can walk you through every step of the process while the courts are closed.

<h2>Updated 7/14/20: Los Angeles County Traffic Court</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 10, 2020 Los Angeles Superior Court Presiding Judge Kevin Brazile issued an order that all traffic courts will remain closed through at least August 8, 2020. Any cases set during this closure will be continued and court appearances will not be required. A notice from the court will be mailed and new court dates will be provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the courts may be closed, The Ticket Clinic is currently open for business. Our offices in Baldwin Park, Glendale, Huntington Park, Long Beach, Santa Ana and Studio City are open to the public.</span></p>
<div class="center bold header">
<p>TRAFFIC COURT CHANGES DURING THE CORONAVIRUS/COVID-19 EMERGENCY</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Court has provided immediate temporary relief for all traffic and non-traffic Infraction matters, including a 90-day extension on all due dates, including dates to pay, dates to appear in the Clerk&#8217;s Office, and dates to appear on tickets. If you have a hearing set before that date, please do not come to the courthouse as you will be turned away. You will receive in the mail a new date for your ticket to be heard after August 10.</p>
<p>If your California driver&#8217;s license is suspended due to unpaid traffic tickets, you can call the Court to set a future hearing date or establish a Payment Plan and have the Court request a release of the driver&#8217;s license hold from the DMV now. You should be aware that COVID-19 has affected the DMV&#8217;s ability to process these requests, so there may be some delays in having the holds lifted.</p>
<p>All court appearances previously scheduled for any time between March 17, 2020, and August 10, 2020, on a traffic infraction or a non-traffic infraction case have been rescheduled to a new date after August 10, 2020. If you did not receive notification of your new date, you may visit the court&#8217;s website at lacourt.org</p>
</div>
<h2>Update 3/30/20: California Traffic Courts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 23, 2020, and until further notice, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County closed the Clerk’s Offices at all 38 courthouses in response to the COVID-19 public health threat. Most courthouses, except the Beverly Hills and Catalina courthouses, will stay open for time-sensitive, essential court hearings and matters in accordance with Presiding Judge Kevin C. Brazile’s General Orders.</p>
<p>With Los Angeles traffic courts closed, citizens with a traffic ticket case in California will not be permitted to appear in court for an in-person hearing. Many traffic matters can be handled without an in-person court appearance, as many transactions can be handled online.</p>
<p>In accordance with the order of the Los Angeles court system and the Presiding Judge signed on March 18, 2020, all traffic-court hearings, including traffic infraction courts, scheduled between March 20, 2020, and April 16, 2020, will be continued for at least 30 days. This action is authorized under the General Order issued by Presiding Judge Brazile signed March 17 to close all courtrooms except to process cases presenting time-sensitive issues and essential functions. Traffic Infraction, Non-Traffic Infraction hearings, including trials, arraignments and other Infraction appearances, will receive updated Court notices by mail to individuals who have a court hearing scheduled within this time frame. These individuals will not be required to come to the courthouse. Instead, the mailed notice will provide a new court date.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have done the research, searching for entry-level jobs that pay a decent wage or salary, and you now know that truck driving is a good option, especially without a college degree. However, now you have to answer a more practical question: how do you become a certified truck driver? Also, once you answer that question, you might be worried about the potential legal risk of driving nearly 10 hours per day or more, which is why, after learning about qualifications, you might want to contact a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/cdl-traffic-ticket">CDL traffic ticket lawyer </a>and discuss your options once trained and hired. However, that is putting the trailer before the cab, so to speak. Therefore, remain focused on the how of becoming a truck driver before anything else.</p>
<h2>Meet Qualifications to Apply</h2>
<p>The hurdles to becoming a licensed truck driver are minimal. In fact, there are typically only three requirements to be a truck driver and get a CDL license.</p>
<ol>
<li>Most states require you to be at least 21 years of age.</li>
<li>You must have a clean driving record with no major violations, such as a DUI.</li>
<li>Most employers and truck driving schools require a diploma or GED, but some programs do not make this mandatory.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Attend Truck Driving School or Apprenticeship Program</h2>
<p>While having <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic ticket lawyers </a>on standby might be a good option for some people, if you attend a reputable truck driving school or enter into a legitimate apprenticeship program, there is no need to worry about excessive ticketing. Truck driving schools and apprenticeships will typically divide your education into two parts: classroom experience and practical learning. In the classroom, you will study the state and federal laws regulating the trucking industry. During your practical learning, you will get hands-on experience driving, operating and maintaining a rig. Apprenticeship programs have the ended benefit of guaranteed job placement after training, but many schools also have job placement tools and relationships in place.</p>
<h2>Pass Examinations</h2>
<p>Once you complete your initial CDL training, you will need to pass both your state and federal examinations. The state exam will be for the CDL license, and it will include a written and driving portion. If you pass this exam, then you will also need to complete the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration exam, which is made up of a written portion and a physical exam. The written part only needs to be completed once, but the physical exam will need to be repeated every two years.</p>
<h2>Find a Job (If Not an Apprentice)</h2>
<p>If you are not enrolled in an apprenticeship program, then you will need to find a job for entry-level CDL drivers. With any luck, your truck driving school of choice will have job placement tools to make this process easier. However, truck driving is an in-demand field, which means that you can likely find employment within 30 to 60 days of passing your exams and receiving your license by calling trucking companies.</p>
<h2>Complete Training</h2>
<p>Once hired, you will need to complete orientation and on-the-job training. Orientation will probably consist of three to five days of learning about the company and completing any necessary paperwork. A training period of several weeks will follow this initial period. You will probably be assigned a mentor who will teach you about policy, routes and paperwork. Once you successfully complete this training period, you will be given your own route and truck.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to become a truck driver, what are you waiting for? Find yourself a school and get started on your new career path. However, don&#8217;t forget the risk of more road time. Find a CDL ticket lawyer to help you if you ever feel that you have been wrongly given a citation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While many wannabe truckers feel that their only concern after getting their CDL license is making sure they have an excellent <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/cdl-traffic-ticket">CDL traffic ticket attorney</a>, they are wrong. A CDL license is a privilege and requires upkeep. In order to obtain and maintain a CDL license, some applicants and current drivers are required to take a physical exam every couple of years. Once they pass their physical exam, they receive a CDL medical card or endorsement known as the Medical Examiner&#8217;s Certificate. Without this endorsement, these truck drivers could lose their jobs. Therefore, it is vital to understand this medical certification.</p>
<h2>Do You Need Certification?</h2>
<p>While it might seem secondary to a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyer</a>, receiving medical certification is paramount to a successful career. However, not every driver is required to receive certification. According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which is an agency within the Department of transportation, medical certification is a requirement of all commercial drivers who operate in interstate commerce. Therefore, if you drive a regional or multi-state route, you are likely required to have and maintain a ME certificate. However, if you only drive locally, then you might be able to forego this certification. You would be best served by talking to your employer, or your state licensing body.</p>
<h2>Where Do You Get Examined?</h2>
<p>While medical cards for CDL might be a requirement, you cannot receive the qualifying examination by just any doctor. As part of the FMCSA requirements, the physician must belong to the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners. While you might feel that this limits the hospitals and locations for your examination, there are actually a variety of medical professionals, located both in urban and rural areas, who can perform your exam. To make the process easier, the FMCSA also provides a searchable database on its website. However, if you want to try your luck, many urgent care centers employ certified MEs.</p>
<h2>What Occurs During the Examination?</h2>
<p>The exam consists of two parts: (1) a five-page report and (2) a physical. The report is filled out by both you and the examiner. You will be asked about any previous surgeries, medications and medical history. If the examiner has any further questions, they will ask probing questions. Then, they will perform a physical exam, checking your vital signs and testing your urine, hearing and vision. Once you have completed these two portions of the exam, the ME will determine if you meet acceptable standards.</p>
<h2>How Do You Get Your Certification?</h2>
<p>If you do meet the acceptable standards of the exam, then the ME will fill out a certificate that is good for 24 months. However, they can require you to come in sooner by providing an earlier expiration. If you do not meet the standards, according to a particular examiner, then the FMCSA allows for a second opinion. Once you have your certificate, you need to make a copy of the certificate and the results to your State Driver Licensing Agency. Failure to send in these documents can result in the loss of your CDL license.</p>
<p>A med card for CDL drivers is a requirement, especially for interstate commerce drivers. This requirement ensures that truckers are healthy and capable of performing the regular duties of the job. Without this certificate, a driver risks their career. However, beyond medical certifications, drivers also need to be diligent about traffic violations, which is why it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have a traffic attorney on standby. Similar to failed physicals, too many traffic violations can sideline an otherwise successful trucking career. Therefore, when scheduling your next physical, also consider scheduling a consultation with a local CDL attorney to discuss road safety and precautions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you even need a CDL license? If you do which is better Class A or B CDL? Maybe you have considered driving without a special license, in which case you better pony up for a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/cdl-traffic-ticket">CDL ticket lawyer</a>. CDL licenses are a requirement for anyone driving a vehicle or a combination of a vehicle and trailer that weighs in excess of 26,001 or more pounds. However, the separate classifications further stipulate the type of vehicles a licensee is qualified to drive and operate. Therefore, what are the classifications, and which license do you need?</p>
<h2>Class A CDL</h2>
<p>In an effort to avoid the need for <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">reckless driving lawyers</a>, it is wise to have the appropriate license for your vehicle and weight class. A Class A license permits a license holder to drive any combination of vehicles rated at 26,001 lbs. or more. This weight class also includes the towing of other vehicles of 10,000 lbs. or more. Furthermore, a Class A CDL driver, with the proper endorsements, can drive several commercial vehicles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tractor-trailers</li>
<li>Tanker vehicles</li>
<li>Livestock carriers</li>
<li>Truck and trailer combinations</li>
<li>Double and triple trailers</li>
<li>Flatbeds</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, with this classification, a driver can also drive Class B and C vehicles, with the proper endorsements. Therefore, Class A licenses are for some of the heaviest and most complicated vehicles.</p>
<h2>Class B CDL</h2>
<p>When researching what vehicles require a CDL license, you are likely to realize that a Class B CDL license is among the most versatile for typical commercial transportation. This license covers single vehicles with a total weight of up to 26,001 lbs. Also, it allows for the towing of another vehicle of no more than 10,000 lbs. While that might sound like a significant limitation, with the proper endorsements, a Class B driver can operate a wide array of commercial vehicles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buses</li>
<li>Straight trucks</li>
<li>Box trucks</li>
<li>Delivery trucks</li>
<li>Segmented buses</li>
<li>Couriers</li>
<li>Dump trucks</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to a Class A CDL, a Class B license allows a properly designated driver to operate vehicles at a lower classification level. Therefore, with appropriate endorsements, a Class B licensee can operate Class C vehicles.</p>
<h2>Class C CDL</h2>
<p>The Class C CDL is a designation for other smaller transport vehicles. For example, if a driver is transporting at least 16 passengers, including themselves, then they a required to carry a Class C license. Also, this classification is necessary for the transportation of hazardous materials. Therefore, you might need this license if you are going to be operating a small HAZMAT vehicle, passenger van or a small truck towing a trailer.</p>
<h2>Endorsements</h2>
<p>Depending on state regulations, you might be required to receive additional endorsements beyond a CDL license. For example, if you are planning on working in a position where your job is to transport hazardous materials, then you might need to take exams for the H endorsement. Or, if you are planning on being a school bus driver, then you might need the S endorsement, which requires the passing of an exam and road test. Several endorsements beyond these are job-specific, such as the X or endorsement for tank vehicles and hazmat operations. Regardless of the endorsement, you will likely be required to take a skills test and a road test in each instance.</p>
<p>There are several different types of CDL licenses and endorsements, but it is difficult to pinpoint which is right for you without knowing your needs and possible job requirements. Therefore, be sure to do your research so that you don&#8217;t end up in legal jeopardy for operating a vehicle without the appropriate license. Although, if you do, you can always reach out to an attorney for assistance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no surprise that people are routinely searching for how to become a CDL driver. There is a growing need in the industry, and companies are desperate for new interest and new candidates. Unfortunately, the long hours and time away from home can be a negative for many people considering their options. Also, with an increase in driving hours, some might be concerned about traffic tickets and their need for a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/cdl-traffic-ticket">CDL traffic ticket attorney</a>. However, as long as drivers go through the appropriate amount of training and pass all of their licensing and road exams, then these concerns can be minimized. Therefore, if you are interested in becoming a truck driver but are anxious about the reality of the experience, then learn the process and become familiar with the qualifications.</p>
<h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
<p>As with most jobs, there are minimum requirements for becoming a truck driver or even training to become a driver. Before you can qualify for a truck driving school or a CDL license, you will need to make sure that you meet several requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>21 years old (requirement in most states)</li>
<li>Legally eligible to work in the state/country</li>
<li>Clean driving record</li>
<li>Diploma or GED (depends on the company and school)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Truck Driving School</h2>
<p>An excellent way to avoid traffic violations and <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic ticket lawyers </a>is to make sure that you are knowledgeable of traffic laws on a state and federal level, which is why you need to attend a truck driving school. Reputable schools offer both classroom and practical skills training. Classroom sessions will typically teach you about truck driving laws and regulations. For practical skills training, you will probably get behind the wheel of an actual commercial vehicle. The tuition and length of each program vary by school. For instance, some intensive programs last only 30 days while longer, more in-depth programs can take a full year.</p>
<h2>Licensing Exam</h2>
<p>Is a CDL a certification? This is a very common question. CDL, however, stands for commercial driver&#8217;s license. Therefore, a CDL is a license and not necessarily a certification. Although, having a CDL demonstrates the successful completion of both a written exam and road test, which both speak to your skills as a commercial driver. Beyond the CDL exams, you can take additional tests for endorsements, which might require further background checks. For example, the hazardous materials endorsement often requires that you pass a background check with the TSA.</p>
<h2>FMCSA Exam</h2>
<p>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration exam is a test that covers both federal traffic law and physical fitness. While the written exam is a one-and-done if you pass, the physical exam is repeated every two years.</p>
<h2>Job Placement</h2>
<p>Many reputable truck driving schools have job placement to help you secure a job after graduation. By attending one of these programs and taking advantage of their industry connections, it is possible to land a job within 30 to 60 days of successful program completion. However, if you are not attending a program with job placement, then consider contacting companies directly.</p>
<h2>Orientation and Training</h2>
<p>Once hired, you will likely need to attend a company orientation and then further training. The orientation will probably last anywhere from three to five days, and you will learn about the company and fill out required paperwork. Then, you will enter the company training period, working alongside a mentor for several weeks or months to learn routes, procedures and company policies.</p>
<h2>Road Test</h2>
<p>After training, you will have to complete another road test and possible written exam. If you pass, then you will probably be assigned your truck and delivery route, which you alone are responsible for.</p>
<p>If you meet the truck driver qualification of being at least 21 years old with a clean driving record, then consider this career option. However, with the increased driving time, have a lawyer on-call.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A CDL is a license classification that is required for most forms of commercial driving. For instance, you cannot operates a tanker truck or move hazardous waste materials without a commercial driver&#8217;s license or without the proper endorsements for that license. However, not every occupation requires such a license. Some box truck drivers do not require a CDL, but if you are interested in driving larger trucks and avoiding legal ramifications and a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/cdl-traffic-ticket">CDL ticket lawyer</a>, then you will likely need an A or B CDL. What is CDL A or B?</p>
<h2>Class A CDL</h2>
<p>If you are going to be driving a semi-truck or tractor-trailer, then you better have a Class A CDL or get yourself some great <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">reckless driving lawyers</a>. This license class pretty much ensures that you can drive any type of commercial vehicle, as long as you have the appropriate endorsements. While these licenses allow you to drive 18 wheelers and anything smaller, it might also be a little overkill if you are not looking to drive larger and heavier rigs. Mainly, a Class A CDL license is required for the operation of any combination of vehicles that reach a weight of 26,001 pounds or more. This specification includes a towed vehicle of 10,000 pounds or more. In this weight class, a license holder would be able to drive a tractor-trailer, tanker vehicles, flatbeds, livestock vehicles and trailer combinations. Additionally, a Class A license will allow the holder to operate any class B vehicles as well.</p>
<h2>Class B CDL</h2>
<p>Why would you want a Class B CDL? What is the difference between class A and class B CDL? Essentially, a Class B license limits the size and weight of the truck a driver can operate. Also, it limits the driver to running only full-frame trucks, which means that tractor-trailers are off-limits. While this license classification does limit the vehicles a commercial driver can operate, not every driver needs the flexibility of a Class A license. A Class B license allows the driver to run several different vehicles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Straight trucks</li>
<li>Segmented buses</li>
<li>Passenger buses</li>
<li>Dump trucks</li>
<li>Garbage trucks</li>
<li>Box trucks or delivery trucks</li>
<li>Food trucks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Career Options</h2>
<p>If you are just considering your career options in truck driving, then it can be challenging to settle on a classification. However, there is no need to decide on a career path right now, especially if you choose a Class A CDL. This license is the most versatile CDL, and it will qualify you to operate almost any commercial vehicle, as long as you receive the necessary endorsements. The only way it is recommended not to pursue a Class A license is if you already know where you are going to work and understand the specific qualifications for your career. However, even when a Class A CDL isn&#8217;t required, it might still be beneficial to acquire one for future career opportunities. The fact is a Class A license provides more driving opportunities, and the path to licensure is similar to a Class B license. Therefore, why choose a more restrictive license?</p>
<p>It is necessary to understand CDL class differences to come to an informed decision about selection. Class A has several advantages over Class B, the most obvious being career opportunities. However, a Class B license might be more than enough for you to gain employment in a specific position. Regardless of your career objectives and which classification you choose, know that a career in truck driving is increasing your road time and thereby your risks of traffic citations. Therefore, once licensed, contact a local CDL ticket attorney to discuss any precautions you should take as a new driver.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every day, millions of California drivers head out on roads that are overburdened with traffic. With congestion far above original design specifications, it’s only a matter of time before a wreck occurs. If you’re involved with a collision with another driver, it’s your responsibility to inform authorities in some circumstances. So, what happens if you don&#8217;t report an accident to the DMV? Here’s a look at the types of wrecks that require reporting and the consequences for motorists who don’t follow this important vehicular law.</p>
<p><strong>Do All Car Accidents Have To Be Reported?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Thousands of car accidents take place every day, but how many of them are serious enough to require reporting to the DMV? If you’ve ever been in a small fender bender but didn’t report it, don’t panic. You’re only required to file a report with officials if it meets certain criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damage to property over $1,000</li>
<li>The crash resulted in an injury of any kind</li>
<li>Anyone involved in the accident died</li>
</ul>
<p>If your crash falls into any of these categories, both parties have to file a report with the DMV. While you don’t have to do it personally, it must be done by an authorized representative such as an attorney or insurance agent. Even if the wreck occurs on private property, you’re still required to report it.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do I Have To Report an Accident to the DMV?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The easy answer to this question is that you’re required to do it by law. Don’t delay in your reporting because you only have 10 days to avoid potential penalties. The only exception to this rule is if your injuries from the crash were so severe you were unable to fill out the required paperwork. If you’re able-bodied and don’t submit a report to the DMV, you could face some real consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to six months in jail</li>
<li>A fine of up to $1,000</li>
<li>Suspension of driving privileges</li>
</ul>
<p>While these penalties are severe enough, you could face an even stiffer punishment if it’s found that you didn’t have insurance at the time of the crash. If you’re worried about consequences in the aftermath of your accident, an experienced <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer"><strong>speeding ticket lawyer </strong></a>might be able to offer assistance.</p>
<p><strong>What To Do After Any Accident</strong></p>
<p>The aftermath of a collision can be extremely stressful, but there are some things you should do after any crash. While it’s helpful to commit this information to memory, you should also print a copy and place it in your glove compartment as an easy reference. Regardless of the accident’s severity, you should take eight steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop your vehicle immediately to avoid “hit-and-run” charges.</li>
<li>Call 911 if there are injuries.</li>
<li>Move vehicles out of the travel lane.</li>
<li>Exchange license and insurance information with the other driver.</li>
<li>Make a written report to the California Highway Patrol within 24 hours in the event of injury or death.</li>
<li>Submit a report to the DMV within 10 days of the accident.</li>
<li>Leave a note with your contact information if you damaged a parked car or any other unattended property.</li>
<li>Call police, animal control or the Humane Society if you hit and injure an animal, but don’t try to move it by yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Don’t Hesitate To Seek Help</strong></p>
<p>Now you know the types of crashes that require a DMV report, you’ll be better prepared to act in the aftermath of a collision. A car accident can have a significant impact on the future for you and your family, which is why you shouldn’t face the consequences alone. No matter if you’ve been cited for speeding or operating a vehicle under the influence, seek professional assistance from <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving"><strong>reckless driving lawyers </strong></a>in your area.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you&#8217;re traveling overseas for longer than a quick vacation, you&#8217;re probably wondering how to get international drivers license. Travelers can apply for a permit allowing them to drive in other countries through either the American Automobile Association and the American Automobile Touring Alliance. Here&#8217;s what you should know about how these documents work and whether you are eligible.</p>
<p><strong>About the Permit</strong></p>
<p>What is an international drivers permit? The so-called IDP is a legal identification card with your driving information, photo and name. These details are translated into 10 different languages (English, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish) and the permit is accepted in 150 countries all over the world. Notably, China does not recognize the IDP and requires motorists to obtain a Chinese driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>When using an IDP to drive, you must also carry your U.S. driver&#8217;s license. Driving in other countries without an IDP can result in hefty fines and the need to hire a global <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyer</a>. Before traveling, check the specific requirements for your destination nation to determine whether the IDP is valid. Having this document can prevent trouble from arising if you get lost, are stopped by law enforcement or have a traffic accident in another country. It also makes it easier for authorities to communicate with you when necessary. Penalties for driving without an IDP vary by country in severity. In Japan, for example, you can be ordered to leave the country for driving without an IDP.</p>
<p><strong>Obtaining an IDP</strong></p>
<p>Where to get an international driving license? If you opt to get an international permit from AAA, you can do so either at a branch office near you or through the mail. You must be at least 18 years old and a permanent resident of the United States. Download the application from the AAA website and submit it along with two original passport-size photos (which can be taken at most branch locations), the $20 permit fee and a valid U.S. driver&#8217;s license. You can pay by check, credit card or money order.</p>
<p>The AATA offers permits only through the mail, but not at in-person locations. This agency does not take credit cards, so you must send a check or money order. You must also pay a shipping fee of $10 in the U.S., $35 for expedited domestic service and $85 for international service.</p>
<p>You should apply for an IDP no more than six months before you plan to travel. The document is good for one year, but may not be used to drive in the U.S. without a valid U.S. driver&#8217;s license. If you apply in person, you will receive your permit on the same day. Mailed applications are usually processed in 10 to 15 business days, though expedited service is often available for a nominal fee.</p>
<p>You do not need to be in the United States to apply for an IDP with your U.S. driver&#8217;s license. If you have already traveled overseas and wish to obtain this documentation so that you can drive, send your application by mail. This option takes up to six weeks for processing and requires an express mail charge of up to $100 according to AAA.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the U.S. Department of State has issued warnings about fraudulent or counterfeit IDPs. To avoid this issue, apply for an international license only through the AAA or AATA.</p>
<p>If you do receive a driving citation while operating a motor vehicle on an IDP in another country, your U.S. driving record will not be affected. For domestic driving offenses, however, you need the legal advocacy of experienced <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic ticket lawyers</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People who habitually drive under the influence of alcohol put themselves and others at risk of injury or death, which is why California requires an ignition interlock device for repeat offenders. If you’ve been ordered by a judge to install one of these devices on your car, you might have your share of questions. No matter if you’re wondering “what happens if I fail my interlock” or anything else about how the program works, here’s a brief FAQ.</p>
<p><strong>Who Must Install an Interlock?</strong></p>
<p>Starting in 2019, California requires the installation of an interlock device for all drivers convicted of multiple DUI offenses or any incident resulting in injury, but more people could fall into this program. A judge has the discretion to impose this restriction on you for a first offense for a few different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your blood alcohol content was higher than .015%</li>
<li>You refused to submit to breath or blood test</li>
<li>You’ve been driving on a suspended license due to DUI convictions<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Long Do You Have To Have an Interlock Device?</strong></p>
<p>For a first offense, the normal amount of time imposed by a judge is 6 months, but the DMV can impose 4 months without a judge’s order if you’re found liable but not convicted. Repeat offenders get longer sentences based on the number of violations:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 year for a second DUI conviction</li>
<li>2 years after your third conviction</li>
<li>3 years for each additional conviction</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidents resulting in injury add extra time to the sentence with first-time offenders getting 1 year and adding an additional year for each subsequent conviction up to 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>How Much Does the Program Cost?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re ordered to install an ignition interlock in your car, there are some costs you’ll have to bear. The initial installation can cost up to $150, but you’ll also need to pay between $60 to $80 each month for monitoring and calibration. For those who are unable to afford these expenses, the program can defer some of the financial responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Who Installs Interlocks?</strong></p>
<p>To comply with the program, you’re required to go to a court-approved installation company. Once you’ve been ordered to install one of these devices, your <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer"><strong>speeding ticket lawyer </strong></a>can help you find an authorized installer.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens if I Fail My Interlock?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>When you want to drive, you’ll first have to blow into the interlock device to prove you don’t have any alcohol in your system. Once you’re out on the road, rolling retests will ensure you aren’t drinking behind the wheel. You’re required to bring the device to the installer every 60 days for calibration, and any failures will be reported to the DMV. If you log too many failed tests, you run the risk of a suspended license.</p>
<p><strong>Can I Drive Without an Interlock in Another State?</strong></p>
<p>While you’re free to cross state lines in your interlock-equipped vehicle, you’re still under the umbrella of the program. If you’re pulled over for driving a different car in another state, you will be penalized.</p>
<p><strong>Are False Positives Possible?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Ignition interlocks are sophisticated devices that generally won’t register false positives from non-alcoholic substances. You could fail a test if you’ve recently used an alcoholic mouthwash or consumed food with alcohol, but an immediate retest will usually come out clean if you swish with water.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Better Driver</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>It’s important to know the ignition interlock program is designed to let you drive when you would otherwise have a suspended license, which is why you should treat it as an opportunity. Loss of driving privileges can be disruptive to your life and livelihood, so don’t hesitate to get help from a personal or <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/cdl-traffic-ticket"><strong>CDL traffic ticket attorney </strong></a>if you’ve been charged with a moving violation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Not all California drivers are certain about how the DMV hold on license works. It is not an automatic driver’s license suspension, and you are allowed to continue driving until the DMV takes action. California places a DMV hold on your driver&#8217;s license when you receive a ticket and if you then fail to appear in court when required. A failure to appear in traffic court can result in a suspended license and also prevent you from renewing it.</p>



<p>When you are issued a ticket, you provide your signature, which is a signed promise that you will appear in court. When provided with a time and date for an appearance, you are required to show up. When you completely ignore the court date, the DMV hold on drivers license goes into effect.</p>



<h3><strong>A No-Show at Traffic Court Can Be Considered a Crime</strong></h3>



<p>In California, a failure to appear in traffic court is a punishable crime. Coming to court is mandatory for certain citations, but you do not need to go out of your way to comply. An online search for <strong><a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/traffic-court">traffic courts near me</a></strong> will provide options for choosing a location convenient enough for you to show up and resolve the matter. Because the DMV makes it easy for people to appear in court, the DMV hold on license occurs when the issue is completely disregarded. Once the hold takes place, all outstanding fines must be paid to remove the DMV hold or you may not be able to renew your driver&#8217;s license.</p>



<h3><strong>There Are Defenses for a DMV Hold</strong></h3>



<p>There are ways to counteract a DMV hold. If there is a legitimate reason you missed your court date, you may provide proof such as a record of an illness or other emergency. You may also be able to prove that you made a mistake or that you did not receive any notice requiring you to show up.</p>



<p>Ignoring a traffic citation may lead to serious consequences. Drivers defending themselves for not appearing in court should consider working with experienced <strong><a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic ticket lawyers</a></strong> to act on their behalf.</p>
