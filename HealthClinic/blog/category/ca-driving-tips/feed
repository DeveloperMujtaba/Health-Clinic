								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less traffic and open highways throughout California are contributing to an uptick in certain types of traffic tickets. Even with fewer people are travelling, law enforcement is working closely with Caltrans on safe transportation initiatives despite decreased driver presence on state roadways due to stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many drivers are taking advantage of less congested roads and are driving with a heavy foot. Speeding violations are on the rise as the California Office of Traffic Safety (COTS) has publicly urged drivers to slow down after seeing an 87% spike in related citations occurred recently.</p>
<h2>A Fast Growing Trend &#8211; Speeding More Than 100MPH</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/news/0OpdRJix/more-drivers-cited-for-speeding-as-traffic-declines">The California Highway Patrol (CHP)</a> reported a whopping 2,493 issuance of citations statewide that involved speeding more than 100 mph since March when stay-at-home guidelines went into effect. CHP says this is nearly double the number compared to the same time last year when 1,335 violations were issued. These shocking new numbers are even more eye-popping when you consider that traffic volume averages are down nearly 35% due to the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Caltrans, CHP, and the Office of Traffic Safety Join Forces</h2>
<p>In a joint effort to encourage motorists to reduce their speeds and be more careful behind the wheel, <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/news-releases/news-release-2020-014">Caltrans</a> teamed up with CHP and the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS). Outside of stepping up a law-enforcement presence on state roads and highways, electronic highway signs will also bear a safety-related message discouraging speeding and emphasizing traveling safely while driving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messages will also remind drivers of the Move Over Law that requires drivers to slow down or move over to a different lane if they see emergency vehicles, tow trucks, Caltrans, and other essential service providers.</p>
<h2>Consequences of Traffic Violations in California</h2>
<p>Despite most California <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/blog/traffic-ticket-case-coronavirus">traffic courts operating on limited availability</a> due to COVID-19 restrictions, those who commit infractions like speeding over 100 mph will receive a citation and be expected to take care of it online and possibly in-person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driving unsafely is taken seriously by California Highway Patrol, and if you get pulled over for this behavior, the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&amp;sectionNum=22348">California Vehicle Code</a> can hand out several punishments in response, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First offenses for speeding could bring fines starting at $238</li>
<li>One point on your driving record</li>
<li>Fines increase for habitual offenders</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, these are just base fines. The actual violation can increase penalties significantly. In cases of speeding at over 100 mph, the vehicle code has specific consequences, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Two points added to your driving record</li>
<li>A fine of up to $500 and a 30-day suspended license just for a first offense</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the second offense in three years, the fine and license suspension period goes up dramatically, even more so for third offenses in less than five years.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The State of California uses airplane units for a wide range of purposes. From surveillance to suspect apprehension to identifying hazardous road conditions, an eye from the sky is a vital part of efficient law enforcement practice. Although these airplane units have many beneficial uses, there are serious questions about their role in traffic enforcement, especially when investigating speeding tickets on a California highway. If you have been issued a speeding ticket based on airplane surveillance, an understanding of how this surveillance works and what mistakes are commonly made can go a long way in defending against the ticket in California traffic court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Air units are not used nearly as much as in the early 2000s when their primary function was traffic enforcement. Although the developments of radar have made it easier for ground units to enforce speed limits, there are still instances of air units&#8217; observations being the sole basis for a speeding ticket being issued. In preparing a defense to a speeding charge, our lawyers are prepared to address the following issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can GPS Speed Tracking Be Presented in Court?</h2>
<p>Air units have recently turned to the use of cameras installed on the belly of the plane that utilizes GPS to determine a vehicle’s speed and location. When the officer feels they have enough data to support a speeding ticket, they can radio an officer on the ground by giving them a vehicle description so that the ground officer can initiate a motor vehicle stop. Although this technology has, in years past, been ruled admissible in traffic court, this does not mean that GPS tracking is considered reliable on all occasions. Our experienced traffic ticket lawyers would attack on cross-examination, especially if the video quality has been compromised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Requiring Two Witnesses to Testify</h2>
<p>Another significant hurdle for law enforcement in sustaining a guilty finding in traffic court is the requirements that both officers involved in the observation and stop of the motor vehicle will be required to testify should the matter proceed to a trial. Live testimony can be difficult enough for one officer, let alone coordinating the schedule of two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the appearance of the officers, there is also the requirement that both testify consistently. The officers must identify not only the speed of the vehicle but also the vehicle’s identity. If each officer testifies as to different characteristics of a vehicle such as the color, make, or model, it will be difficult for a traffic court judge to find that the officers have presented sufficient evidence to support a conviction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Breaking The Chain of Testimony</h2>
<p>Even if the air and ground officers testify consistently about their observations, they still must testify accurately as to what information was relayed between the two to support the stop. A simple explanation of, &#8220;I received information&#8221; should be insufficient unless the officers can provide exact details as to when what and how the information was relayed. Even a slight break in the chain of data can be enough to argue that when the ground officer activated their lights, they did not have the reasonable suspicion that the vehicle they pulled over was the proper suspect in the speeding complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Challenging Technology</h2>
<p>Whether the air unit uses the old fashion, stopwatch, and grid approach, or if they have the luxury of the more sophisticated GPS tracking, the technology is only as good as the reliability of the technology and the reliability of the user of the technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are maintenance requirements for devices that are utilized to calculate speed, allowing a suspect to challenge the technology&#8217;s reliability if the officer cannot show that the maintenance procedure was followed before its use. Depending on the judge, it can be requested at a hearing that the officer produces sufficient maintenance records to support the device&#8217;s reliability. If they fail to do so, this could open the door for our lawyers to challenge that the officer has not shown clearly and convincingly that the speed reading they testified to is, in fact, accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California speeding tickets are serious matters that should be resolved immediately. Convictions for speeding can result in insurance increases and can put your driving privileges at risk of being revoked. Do not assume that simply because a law enforcement officer in the air says so, that you are, in fact, guilty of committing a speeding infraction. The lawyers at The Ticket Clinic are standing by to help you with any traffic violation. Call us for a free consultation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) are notoriously expensive, especially in California where court fines and fees can add up to thousands of dollars over the base price of the ticket. An experienced <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI lawyer </a>can negotiate on your behalf and potentially lower the cost of your charges. Can DUI be reduced to reckless driving? These common strategies are often used to reduce DUI fees.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Wet Reckless</strong></span></p>
<p>Can DUI be reduced? Often, an attorney will seek a plea bargain for a lesser charge to reduce your DUI penalties. Common lesser charges include a so-called “wet reckless” (reckless driving that involved alcohol), “dry reckless” or speeding.</p>
<p>Is reckless driving worse than DUI? Not when it comes to costs. Most reckless driving offenses do not carry jail time and have lower fees, less impact on auto insurance costs and no required license suspension. However, a wet reckless may still count as a prior DUI offense if you are charged with DUI again within 10 years in California.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Dry Reckless</strong></span></p>
<p>A dry reckless offense will not count as a prior DUI. It’s also less likely to carry a license suspension or require installation of an ignition interlock device, both possibilities if you plead guilty to a wet reckless. However, it may result in points added to your driving record. A <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">lawyer for reckless driving </a>may be able to negotiate these charges down.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Other Charges</strong></span></p>
<p>Although a speeding ticket is costly, it is less expensive than a DUI. When the case for prosecuting a DUI is weak, an attorney may argue for minor charges. These can include a charge for public drunkenness, drinking in a vehicle or other traffic infractions.</p>
<p>Both wet and dry recklessness charges carry a mandatory minimum fine of $145, compared to a mandatory minimum of $390 for a DUI. Talk to an attorney today if you have been charged with DUI and are concerned about the cost of this conviction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted speed limits are straightforward figures displayed on roadside boards, and the law requires motorists to drive at or under that number. However, a problem arises when you find yourself driving with the flow of traffic in California and you notice your speed is well over the speed limit. When you are one of many traveling 10 or 20 miles an hour past the limit, can police officers give you a ticket? <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">Speeding ticket lawyers </a>from California admit it can be a problem in modern traffic situations.</p>
<p><strong>California Traffic</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who drives in California knows how difficult it can be to navigate the highways and freeways of the state any time of the day or night. Cars on these roads can be found engaging in a wide range of unsafe practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving at a crawl</li>
<li>Weaving in and out of traffic</li>
<li>Speeding along together</li>
</ul>
<p>You may wonder what happens if you are traveling at the same speed as all the other vehicles around you, but that speed is well over the posted limit. If you are simply keeping up with all the other cars in your lane, does the flow of traffic law Californiamean you could still get a speeding ticket? The short answer is yes.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>According to California law, the posted limit is the absolute maximum allowable speed for all automobiles except for emergency vehicles. Whether the other motorists around your own vehicle are traveling at speeds in excess of the law does not keep you from being responsible for your own actions. The posted limit is meant for all vehicles on the road individually, and few exemptions are given.</p>
<p>If you find yourself fighting a citation under the California speeding ticket law, you can contact speeding and <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">reckless driving lawyers </a>near you and let them help you by using trusted defense tactics. California traffic attorneys have the skills and experience to help you fight the ticket.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether it&#8217;s an intersection without much traffic or a rushed day, it is easy to glide through a stop sign if no vehicles are in sight. Often referred to as a California rollstop sign, this practice may result in a ticket and a point on your driving record. Here are some tips about this common traffic violation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rolling Stops Have Consequences</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Some drivers think a rolling stop isn&#8217;t a big deal and assume they will just get a warning. In reality, officers consider rolling stops a hazard to pedestrians, bike riders and other vehicles, and they do not overlook them.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> California Law Is Specific </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>According to Code 22450 VC, all drivers must make a complete stop at every stop sign. This means all wheels have stopped, and the speedometer is at zero. The law also states the driver must stop at the white line on the road, also called the limit line, or at the entrance to the intersection if there is no line.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Violations Cost Money</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The rolling stop ticket costis not cheap. At present, it is approaching $250. Other expenses, such as insurance premium increases, also add to the financial impact, so contacting <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic ticket lawyers </a>may make sense.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Violations Can Mean Traffic School</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A rolling stop ticket puts one point on your driving record, but completing traffic school may remove the point from your license. If you have multiple offenses on your record, the court may order you to attend this program, usually held on evenings or weekends.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Railroad Stop Signs and Red Lights Pose Dangers </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Rolling through a stop sign at a railroad crossing constitutes a serious violation with a steeper fine because it causes imminent danger. If an officer observes a motorist rolling through a red light, he may choose to issue either a rolling stop ticket or a red light violation.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies in California issue a rolling stop ticket because the practice endangers everyone on the road. If you get caught up in this situation, consult with <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">reckless driving lawyers </a>for advice on steps to take.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In general, a police speed trap is any technique used by police to catch speeders with the primary intent of raising revenue through issuing tickets. When police enforce speed limits to ensure safety, it is not a speed trap. However, enforcement isn’t always so genuinely motivated. If the goal is to issue tickets to meet quotas and charge fees, then it is a speed trap.</p>
<p>Depending on the tactic used, speed traps may be illegal in California. However, many strategies are completely legal. Additionally, even with prohibited techniques, you may need a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyer </a>to help you challenge the ticket.</p>
<h4><strong>When Speed Traps Are Illegal in California</strong></h4>
<p>The above begs the questions: when are speed traps legal and when aren’t they? The traps prohibited under California’s speed trapping laws are “marked road traps” and “unjustified speed limit traps.”</p>
<p>The former of these prohibited police speed trap techniques is a section of road that has been marked for measuring the speed of a vehicle by calculating travel time. In other words, it is a method of catching speeders by seeing if they travel between two points more quickly than legally should be able to.</p>
<p>The second of these tactics is a section of road that has an unjustified drop in the speed limit. This technique causes people to speed if they don’t notice a change in the speed limit without any change in the road conditions that would justify a lower speed.</p>
<h4><strong>Challenging Speed Trap Tickets</strong></h4>
<p>If you receive a speeding ticket as the result of a speed trap you can challenge it in California. Even if it was not issued due to one of the above-mentioned techniques, you may still be able to get it thrown out or reduced.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California drivers as well as those who are just passing through should be aware of the state&#8217;s four major speed laws. If you run into trouble and receive an expensive fine or points on your license, <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyers </a>can advocate on your behalf. Here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>
<h4><strong>Basic Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>According to the California basic speed law, drivers cannot exceed a safe speed for the current road and weather conditions. Even when you are adhering to the posted speed limit, you can get a ticket if the officer determines you are driving too fast for the number of cars on the road, the road surface, the general flow of traffic, the weather and/or the presence of cyclists or pedestrians.</p>
<h4><strong>Maximum Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>This law prohibits drivers from exceeding a posted speed limit. On most California highways, the maximum speed is 65 miles per hour though some roads allow a speed of up to 70 mph. For a two-lane highway with no dividers, 55 mph is the maximum speed limit unless otherwise posted.</p>
<h4><strong>Minimum Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>The minimum speed law says that drivers can be cited for driving too slow if they are interrupting the flow of traffic. In addition, some roads have a posted minimum speed limit.</p>
<h4><strong>Prima Facie Speed Limit</strong></h4>
<p>This California law establishes maximum speed limits that must be observed in areas where no speed limit is posted. Prima facie speed limits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>25 miles per hour in school zones, residential areas and business districts</li>
<li>15 miles per hour in alleys, railroad crossings and highway intersections with less than 100 feet of visibility</li>
</ul>
<p>A first-time speeding offense carries a fine of up to $100 depending on the circumstances of your case. If you were driving faster than 100 mph, you could receive a six-month license suspension and a $500 fine. Subsequent offenses carry higher fine and even jail time. If you&#8217;ve been charged with breaking any of these four speed limit laws, a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/accidents">driving accident lawyer </a>can fight for you in court.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have been charged with driving under the influence but did not drink before driving, you are likely both frightened about facing drunk driving penalties and confused about how the breathalyzer test detected alcohol in your system. Can you fail a breathalyzer test from mouthwash? Get the facts, then seek <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI assistance </a>from a qualified criminal defense attorney.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>The Impact of Mouthwash on a Breathalyzer</strong></h4>
<p>While a breathalyzer test is designed to analyze the alcohol content of air deep within the lungs, this air must pass from the alveoli and up through the trachea before exiting through the mouth for testing. When this occurs, the mouthwash alcohol content can increase the alcohol content of this so-called alveolar air and create a false high reading, leading to a DUI charge.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Factors That Cause Breathalyzer Error</strong></h4>
<p>Mouthwash isn&#8217;t the only substance that can cause a false breathalyzer reading. Beyond mouthwash and breathalyzer test, this screening can be affected by recent consumption of a cough drop, menthol cigarette, chewing gum or countless other things.</p>
<p>Residual mouth alcohol gets trapped within crevices of the mouth as well as around piercings and fillings. In addition, individuals who have a stomach condition called GERD often expel digestive gas that can cause a high reading. Certain medications, including asthma prescriptions, can lead to a high blood alcohol level even without intoxication.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Steps To Take After a False Breathalyzer</strong></h4>
<p>If you think mouth alcohol is the source of your DUI charge, ask for a retest. A breathalyzer reading that drops significantly after 10 to 30 minutes often signifies the presence of mouth alcohol. Cooperate with the investigation, but immediately seek legal advice and gather any potential evidence that supports your assertion of a false reading.</p>
<p>Penalties for DUI include steep fines, loss of license and even jail time. A <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic offense ticket lawyer </a>can advocate on your behalf in court if you believe you have been erroneously charged with a DUI. He or she will investigate the type of equipment used, your habits and activities on the day of the incident and the research studies behind false positives to mount a defense.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a California driver, you may have heard that the California cell phone driving law prohibits texting or calling while driving. This is true to a certain extent. However, like most laws, it is a little more complex than that. Below is some valuable information on what is and isn’t legal. If you find yourself in trouble for using a phone while driving, a calling / <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/texting-driving">texting and driving ticket lawyer </a>may be able to help.</p>
<h3><strong>What Is California’s Cell Phone Law for Drivers?</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>In California, drivers may not use cell phones to call or text while driving with a few exceptions. Most relevant for the majority of situations is that using a hands-free cell phone system is allowed if the driver is 18 or older. The law defines a hands-free system as being one with the cellphone mounted on the windshield or dashboard and that the driver can activate or deactivate with a single swipe or tap.</p>
<p>Additionally, drivers may use a cell phone, even a handheld one, to make emergency calls to law enforcement or other emergency services. The California cell phone law only applies to drivers on public roads. If you are on private property, you can use a cell phone while driving.</p>
<h3><strong>What Are The Punishments?</strong></h3>
<p>The fine for breaking this law is $20 for the first violation and $50 for subsequent violations. However, you will likely pay more due to the addition of assessments. The total will likely be over $150 for the first offense and over $250 for subsequent offenses.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons you may have found yourself scheduled to appear in court, from getting a speeding ticket or failing to stop at a red light to DUI and reckless driving. If this is your first offense, here is some insight into a typical day in traffic court.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Your Day in Court</strong></h4>
<p>The first date that you will have the opportunity to present your case is called the arraignment. Arrive early to ensure you can find the courtroom and take a few minutes to prepare before the proceedings begin. Make sure you bring all documentation you need to present your case.</p>
<p>When the courtroom opens, you will be one among many individuals at the courthouse for the same or similar offenses. A clerk or bailiff may explain the rules and how the courtroom process works. After being sworn in, the judge will take the bench and begin calling cases.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Your Plea</strong></h4>
<p>When your name is called, you and your <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/accidents">accident ticket lawyer </a>will move to the podium to state your plea in front of the judge. You usually have two options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admit fault &#8211;</strong>This means you enter a “no contest” or a guilty plea. In most states, the judge has the authority to reduce the fine, which can make it worth spending the day in court.</li>
<li><strong>Plead not guilty –</strong>If you are fighting a speeding ticket, this is equivalent to requesting a trial. A date is set if the officer comes to court. If you don’t already have a traffic ticket attorney, you should consider retaining one.</li>
</ul>
