								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) are notoriously expensive, especially in California where court fines and fees can add up to thousands of dollars over the base price of the ticket. An experienced <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI lawyer </a>can negotiate on your behalf and potentially lower the cost of your charges. Can DUI be reduced to reckless driving? These common strategies are often used to reduce DUI fees.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Wet Reckless</strong></span></p>
<p>Can DUI be reduced? Often, an attorney will seek a plea bargain for a lesser charge to reduce your DUI penalties. Common lesser charges include a so-called “wet reckless” (reckless driving that involved alcohol), “dry reckless” or speeding.</p>
<p>Is reckless driving worse than DUI? Not when it comes to costs. Most reckless driving offenses do not carry jail time and have lower fees, less impact on auto insurance costs and no required license suspension. However, a wet reckless may still count as a prior DUI offense if you are charged with DUI again within 10 years in California.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Dry Reckless</strong></span></p>
<p>A dry reckless offense will not count as a prior DUI. It’s also less likely to carry a license suspension or require installation of an ignition interlock device, both possibilities if you plead guilty to a wet reckless. However, it may result in points added to your driving record. A <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">lawyer for reckless driving </a>may be able to negotiate these charges down.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Other Charges</strong></span></p>
<p>Although a speeding ticket is costly, it is less expensive than a DUI. When the case for prosecuting a DUI is weak, an attorney may argue for minor charges. These can include a charge for public drunkenness, drinking in a vehicle or other traffic infractions.</p>
<p>Both wet and dry recklessness charges carry a mandatory minimum fine of $145, compared to a mandatory minimum of $390 for a DUI. Talk to an attorney today if you have been charged with DUI and are concerned about the cost of this conviction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have been charged with driving under the influence but did not drink before driving, you are likely both frightened about facing drunk driving penalties and confused about how the breathalyzer test detected alcohol in your system. Can you fail a breathalyzer test from mouthwash? Get the facts, then seek <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI assistance </a>from a qualified criminal defense attorney.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>The Impact of Mouthwash on a Breathalyzer</strong></h4>
<p>While a breathalyzer test is designed to analyze the alcohol content of air deep within the lungs, this air must pass from the alveoli and up through the trachea before exiting through the mouth for testing. When this occurs, the mouthwash alcohol content can increase the alcohol content of this so-called alveolar air and create a false high reading, leading to a DUI charge.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Factors That Cause Breathalyzer Error</strong></h4>
<p>Mouthwash isn&#8217;t the only substance that can cause a false breathalyzer reading. Beyond mouthwash and breathalyzer test, this screening can be affected by recent consumption of a cough drop, menthol cigarette, chewing gum or countless other things.</p>
<p>Residual mouth alcohol gets trapped within crevices of the mouth as well as around piercings and fillings. In addition, individuals who have a stomach condition called GERD often expel digestive gas that can cause a high reading. Certain medications, including asthma prescriptions, can lead to a high blood alcohol level even without intoxication.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Steps To Take After a False Breathalyzer</strong></h4>
<p>If you think mouth alcohol is the source of your DUI charge, ask for a retest. A breathalyzer reading that drops significantly after 10 to 30 minutes often signifies the presence of mouth alcohol. Cooperate with the investigation, but immediately seek legal advice and gather any potential evidence that supports your assertion of a false reading.</p>
<p>Penalties for DUI include steep fines, loss of license and even jail time. A <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic offense ticket lawyer </a>can advocate on your behalf in court if you believe you have been erroneously charged with a DUI. He or she will investigate the type of equipment used, your habits and activities on the day of the incident and the research studies behind false positives to mount a defense.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a driver is pulled over in California and the police officer suspects that he or she is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the driver can choose to have either a blood or breath test. These tests are designed to determine the driver&#8217;s blood alcohol content (BAC). Readings of more than .08% will result in a driving under the influence (DUI) charge. Here&#8217;s what you need to know about a DUI blood test California.</p>
<h2><strong>Is a Blood Test Accurate?</strong></h2>
<p>A good <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI lawyer </a>will always raise concerns about DUI blood test accuracy. The readings received on these tests can vary from your actual blood alcohol level by between 4% and 10%. This means that even though the test says you were driving under the influence, your actual BAC may have been well below the legal limit.</p>
<p>External factors can also affect the accuracy of a DUI blood test. For example, if the skin is swabbed with ethyl alcohol by a technician before the sample is drawn, it could cause a falsely elevated reading.</p>
<h2><strong>What Are the Laws Associated With a DUI Blood Test?</strong></h2>
<p>A blood test to screen for DUI must be administered according to certain state regulations. The test must be performed by a licensed medical technician, properly combined with preservative and anti-coagulant solutions, labeled correctly and stored for at least one year.</p>
<h2><strong>What Should I Do if I Am Charged?</strong></h2>
<p>You have the right to seek independent lab testing of your BAC blood test results. These independent findings are admissible in court and may prove your innocence in a DUI case. The DUI blood test results time is usually about four to six weeks, so make sure to plan accordingly when it comes to your court date.</p>
<h2>Additional Information on DUI Testing</h2>
<p>When you drive in California, you have already consented to be tested for alcohol or drugs if you are under suspicion for driving under the influence. The most common tests are blood and breath tests, but in certain cases a urine sample may be taken.  If the DUI test resultsshow a BAC of more than .08%, and you have already taken a preliminary alcohol screening or a breath test, you could still be required to take a blood or urine test, if the officer believes you may be under the influence of the drugs. This is because the PAS or a breath test does not measure drug levels.</p>
<p>At this time, you do not have the right to request the presence of an attorney before completing a test, even though you might not understood what is a DUI blood test. Essentially, a sample of your blood is taken and then measured for the percentage of alcohol or drugs present.  Refusing to submit to a blood or urine test could result in your driving privileges being suspended.</p>
<h2>Facts on Penalties</h2>
<p>The penalties for a DUI conviction are severe. A first-time offense typically costs between $400-1,000 in fines. You could also face up to six months in jail, and your vehicle could be impounded and subject to storage fees. You will be required to complete a DUI driving program. Penalties for DUIs are progressive and increase if the BAC reaches certain thresholds and for repeated offenses.</p>
<h2>Information on Avoiding DUIs</h2>
<p>The best course of action is to not drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If you plan to be out drinking make sure to arrange a safe way home, such as calling a taxi or having a friend who is not drinking take the wheel. If you do get arrested, make sure to contact professional legal help. Learning how to avoid DUIconvictions will save you a lot of trouble and money.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been charged with a DUI in California after submitting to a blood test, you need the advice of an experienced <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">lawyer for reckless driving</a>. He or she can gather the necessary evidence to advocate on your behalf for lower penalties or even case dismissal.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is a DUI a felony in California? Most instances of driving under the influence (DUI) are considered misdemeanor charges, which carry less serious penalties.

If you&#8217;ve been charged with this crime, you need the advice and guidance of an experienced <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI ticket lawyer</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Previous Felony DUI</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone who has had a felony DUI conviction within 10 years will automatically receive a felony charge for a subsequent DUI offense. Penalties are similar to those for other felony DUI cases and may vary dramatically depending on the circumstances of your case. What is a DUI felony? In California, a felony is any offense that carries a minimum prison sentence of at least a year.</p>
<h3><strong>Serious Bodily Harm</strong></h3>
<p>When does a DUI become a felony? One such instance is an accident in which another person suffers serious injury or death. In the case of severe injury, the judge has discretion to make either a misdemeanor or felony charge. A felony injury DUI carries fines between $390 and $5,000 along with a prison sentence ranging from 16 months to four years depending on the circumstances of your case.</p>
<h3><strong>DUI Frequency</strong></h3>
<p>If you already have three or more DUI convictions and receive a fourth conviction in the same 10-year period, the new charge will be considered a felony. This includes both DUI charges in California and those from other states as well as any reckless driving charges associated with alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Penalties for this offense include mandatory completion of a 30-month alcohol abuse rehabilitation program, 16 months in state prison and up to $18,000 in fines. Your license can also be indefinitely revoked.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;ve been arrested for your first DUI offense in California or you&#8217;re facing serious jail time for your fourth offense, you need to consult a good <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">reckless driving lawyer</a>. He or she can negotiate for lower penalties based on the facts of your case.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons you may have found yourself scheduled to appear in court, from getting a speeding ticket or failing to stop at a red light to DUI and reckless driving. If this is your first offense, here is some insight into a typical day in traffic court.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Your Day in Court</strong></h4>
<p>The first date that you will have the opportunity to present your case is called the arraignment. Arrive early to ensure you can find the courtroom and take a few minutes to prepare before the proceedings begin. Make sure you bring all documentation you need to present your case.</p>
<p>When the courtroom opens, you will be one among many individuals at the courthouse for the same or similar offenses. A clerk or bailiff may explain the rules and how the courtroom process works. After being sworn in, the judge will take the bench and begin calling cases.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Your Plea</strong></h4>
<p>When your name is called, you and your <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/accidents">accident ticket lawyer </a>will move to the podium to state your plea in front of the judge. You usually have two options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admit fault &#8211;</strong>This means you enter a “no contest” or a guilty plea. In most states, the judge has the authority to reduce the fine, which can make it worth spending the day in court.</li>
<li><strong>Plead not guilty –</strong>If you are fighting a speeding ticket, this is equivalent to requesting a trial. A date is set if the officer comes to court. If you don’t already have a traffic ticket attorney, you should consider retaining one.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Contact Us Today</strong></h4>
<p>Engaging a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyer </a>can help you fight the ticket if it was the result of a speed trap, even if the officer had a radar gun.
