								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California has a few new traffic laws that are set to go into effect in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new laws were released mid December by the California Highway Patrol. They start Jan. 1, unless otherwise noted. </span></p>
<h2><b>Emergency vehicle safety</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers are now required to slow down or change lanes when approaching stationary emergency vehicles with emergency lights, such as a tow truck or California Highway Patrol car, on local streets and roads. Previously, such slowing was only required on freeways.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://beworkzonealert.com/move-over.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This law is designed to protect law enforcement officials </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or first responders who may be outside of their vehicles while responding to emergencies. We urge you to be extra cautious when passing all accident scenes or disabled vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, authorized emergency vehicles can now use </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQJGUynM-6w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a &#8220;Hi-Lo&#8221; warning sound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is different from a siren. It will be used to notify the public of an immediate need to evacuate an area for an emergency. </span></p>
<h2><b>Law </b><b>To Help Unattended Children For </b><b>Good Samaritans</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bystanders and passersby will not face civil or criminal liability for damaging vehicles in order to remove unattended children, age 6 or younger, who are in immediate danger from heat, cold, lack of ventilation or other dangerous circumstances. This law has been created in response to an uptick of incidents related to children stuck inside vehicles.</span></p>
<h2><b>Traffic Ticket And Points For Distracted driving</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning July 1 2021, driving while using a cell phone &#8220;in a handheld manner&#8221; can result in a point being added to a driver&#8217;s record. This penalty applies if the violation is the second to occur within 36 months of being convicted of the same offense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four points within 12 months, six within 24 months or eight within 36 months could lead to a suspended license, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law applies to anyone caught talking on the phone or texting while driving unless they&#8217;re using a hands-free device. Anyone under the age of 18 cannot use any devices while driving. Put the phone down and do your part to combat distracted driving. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) are notoriously expensive, especially in California where court fines and fees can add up to thousands of dollars over the base price of the ticket. An experienced <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI lawyer </a>can negotiate on your behalf and potentially lower the cost of your charges. Can DUI be reduced to reckless driving? These common strategies are often used to reduce DUI fees.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Wet Reckless</strong></span></p>
<p>Can DUI be reduced? Often, an attorney will seek a plea bargain for a lesser charge to reduce your DUI penalties. Common lesser charges include a so-called “wet reckless” (reckless driving that involved alcohol), “dry reckless” or speeding.</p>
<p>Is reckless driving worse than DUI? Not when it comes to costs. Most reckless driving offenses do not carry jail time and have lower fees, less impact on auto insurance costs and no required license suspension. However, a wet reckless may still count as a prior DUI offense if you are charged with DUI again within 10 years in California.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Dry Reckless</strong></span></p>
<p>A dry reckless offense will not count as a prior DUI. It’s also less likely to carry a license suspension or require installation of an ignition interlock device, both possibilities if you plead guilty to a wet reckless. However, it may result in points added to your driving record. A <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">lawyer for reckless driving </a>may be able to negotiate these charges down.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Other Charges</strong></span></p>
<p>Although a speeding ticket is costly, it is less expensive than a DUI. When the case for prosecuting a DUI is weak, an attorney may argue for minor charges. These can include a charge for public drunkenness, drinking in a vehicle or other traffic infractions.</p>
<p>Both wet and dry recklessness charges carry a mandatory minimum fine of $145, compared to a mandatory minimum of $390 for a DUI. Talk to an attorney today if you have been charged with DUI and are concerned about the cost of this conviction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted speed limits are straightforward figures displayed on roadside boards, and the law requires motorists to drive at or under that number. However, a problem arises when you find yourself driving with the flow of traffic in California and you notice your speed is well over the speed limit. When you are one of many traveling 10 or 20 miles an hour past the limit, can police officers give you a ticket? <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">Speeding ticket lawyers </a>from California admit it can be a problem in modern traffic situations.</p>
<p><strong>California Traffic</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who drives in California knows how difficult it can be to navigate the highways and freeways of the state any time of the day or night. Cars on these roads can be found engaging in a wide range of unsafe practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving at a crawl</li>
<li>Weaving in and out of traffic</li>
<li>Speeding along together</li>
</ul>
<p>You may wonder what happens if you are traveling at the same speed as all the other vehicles around you, but that speed is well over the posted limit. If you are simply keeping up with all the other cars in your lane, does the flow of traffic law Californiamean you could still get a speeding ticket? The short answer is yes.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>According to California law, the posted limit is the absolute maximum allowable speed for all automobiles except for emergency vehicles. Whether the other motorists around your own vehicle are traveling at speeds in excess of the law does not keep you from being responsible for your own actions. The posted limit is meant for all vehicles on the road individually, and few exemptions are given.</p>
<p>If you find yourself fighting a citation under the California speeding ticket law, you can contact speeding and <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">reckless driving lawyers </a>near you and let them help you by using trusted defense tactics. California traffic attorneys have the skills and experience to help you fight the ticket.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether it&#8217;s an intersection without much traffic or a rushed day, it is easy to glide through a stop sign if no vehicles are in sight. Often referred to as a California rollstop sign, this practice may result in a ticket and a point on your driving record. Here are some tips about this common traffic violation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rolling Stops Have Consequences</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Some drivers think a rolling stop isn&#8217;t a big deal and assume they will just get a warning. In reality, officers consider rolling stops a hazard to pedestrians, bike riders and other vehicles, and they do not overlook them.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> California Law Is Specific </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>According to Code 22450 VC, all drivers must make a complete stop at every stop sign. This means all wheels have stopped, and the speedometer is at zero. The law also states the driver must stop at the white line on the road, also called the limit line, or at the entrance to the intersection if there is no line.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Violations Cost Money</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The rolling stop ticket costis not cheap. At present, it is approaching $250. Other expenses, such as insurance premium increases, also add to the financial impact, so contacting <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic ticket lawyers </a>may make sense.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Violations Can Mean Traffic School</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A rolling stop ticket puts one point on your driving record, but completing traffic school may remove the point from your license. If you have multiple offenses on your record, the court may order you to attend this program, usually held on evenings or weekends.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Railroad Stop Signs and Red Lights Pose Dangers </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Rolling through a stop sign at a railroad crossing constitutes a serious violation with a steeper fine because it causes imminent danger. If an officer observes a motorist rolling through a red light, he may choose to issue either a rolling stop ticket or a red light violation.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies in California issue a rolling stop ticket because the practice endangers everyone on the road. If you get caught up in this situation, consult with <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">reckless driving lawyers </a>for advice on steps to take.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In general, a police speed trap is any technique used by police to catch speeders with the primary intent of raising revenue through issuing tickets. When police enforce speed limits to ensure safety, it is not a speed trap. However, enforcement isn’t always so genuinely motivated. If the goal is to issue tickets to meet quotas and charge fees, then it is a speed trap.</p>
<p>Depending on the tactic used, speed traps may be illegal in California. However, many strategies are completely legal. Additionally, even with prohibited techniques, you may need a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyer </a>to help you challenge the ticket.</p>
<h4><strong>When Speed Traps Are Illegal in California</strong></h4>
<p>The above begs the questions: when are speed traps legal and when aren’t they? The traps prohibited under California’s speed trapping laws are “marked road traps” and “unjustified speed limit traps.”</p>
<p>The former of these prohibited police speed trap techniques is a section of road that has been marked for measuring the speed of a vehicle by calculating travel time. In other words, it is a method of catching speeders by seeing if they travel between two points more quickly than legally should be able to.</p>
<p>The second of these tactics is a section of road that has an unjustified drop in the speed limit. This technique causes people to speed if they don’t notice a change in the speed limit without any change in the road conditions that would justify a lower speed.</p>
<h4><strong>Challenging Speed Trap Tickets</strong></h4>
<p>If you receive a speeding ticket as the result of a speed trap you can challenge it in California. Even if it was not issued due to one of the above-mentioned techniques, you may still be able to get it thrown out or reduced.</p>
<h4><strong>Contact Us</strong></h4>
<p>Don’t let police speed traps or other tickets go unchallenged. Trust your speeding and <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">reckless driving lawyers </a>to help you fight unfair tickets and get the best possible outcomes even when you’ve made a mistake.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California drivers as well as those who are just passing through should be aware of the state&#8217;s four major speed laws. If you run into trouble and receive an expensive fine or points on your license, <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyers </a>can advocate on your behalf. Here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>
<h4><strong>Basic Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>According to the California basic speed law, drivers cannot exceed a safe speed for the current road and weather conditions. Even when you are adhering to the posted speed limit, you can get a ticket if the officer determines you are driving too fast for the number of cars on the road, the road surface, the general flow of traffic, the weather and/or the presence of cyclists or pedestrians.</p>
<h4><strong>Maximum Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>This law prohibits drivers from exceeding a posted speed limit. On most California highways, the maximum speed is 65 miles per hour though some roads allow a speed of up to 70 mph. For a two-lane highway with no dividers, 55 mph is the maximum speed limit unless otherwise posted.</p>
<h4><strong>Minimum Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>The minimum speed law says that drivers can be cited for driving too slow if they are interrupting the flow of traffic. In addition, some roads have a posted minimum speed limit.</p>
<h4><strong>Prima Facie Speed Limit</strong></h4>
<p>This California law establishes maximum speed limits that must be observed in areas where no speed limit is posted. Prima facie speed limits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>25 miles per hour in school zones, residential areas and business districts</li>
<li>15 miles per hour in alleys, railroad crossings and highway intersections with less than 100 feet of visibility</li>
</ul>
<p>A first-time speeding offense carries a fine of up to $100 depending on the circumstances of your case. If you were driving faster than 100 mph, you could receive a six-month license suspension and a $500 fine. Subsequent offenses carry higher fine and even jail time. If you&#8217;ve been charged with breaking any of these four speed limit laws, a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/accidents">driving accident lawyer </a>can fight for you in court.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have been charged with driving under the influence but did not drink before driving, you are likely both frightened about facing drunk driving penalties and confused about how the breathalyzer test detected alcohol in your system. Can you fail a breathalyzer test from mouthwash? Get the facts, then seek <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI assistance </a>from a qualified criminal defense attorney.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>The Impact of Mouthwash on a Breathalyzer</strong></h4>
<p>While a breathalyzer test is designed to analyze the alcohol content of air deep within the lungs, this air must pass from the alveoli and up through the trachea before exiting through the mouth for testing. When this occurs, the mouthwash alcohol content can increase the alcohol content of this so-called alveolar air and create a false high reading, leading to a DUI charge.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Factors That Cause Breathalyzer Error</strong></h4>
<p>Mouthwash isn&#8217;t the only substance that can cause a false breathalyzer reading. Beyond mouthwash and breathalyzer test, this screening can be affected by recent consumption of a cough drop, menthol cigarette, chewing gum or countless other things.</p>
<p>Residual mouth alcohol gets trapped within crevices of the mouth as well as around piercings and fillings. In addition, individuals who have a stomach condition called GERD often expel digestive gas that can cause a high reading. Certain medications, including asthma prescriptions, can lead to a high blood alcohol level even without intoxication.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Steps To Take After a False Breathalyzer</strong></h4>
<p>If you think mouth alcohol is the source of your DUI charge, ask for a retest. A breathalyzer reading that drops significantly after 10 to 30 minutes often signifies the presence of mouth alcohol. Cooperate with the investigation, but immediately seek legal advice and gather any potential evidence that supports your assertion of a false reading.</p>
<p>Penalties for DUI include steep fines, loss of license and even jail time. A <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services">traffic offense ticket lawyer </a>can advocate on your behalf in court if you believe you have been erroneously charged with a DUI. He or she will investigate the type of equipment used, your habits and activities on the day of the incident and the research studies behind false positives to mount a defense.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a driver is pulled over in California and the police officer suspects that he or she is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the driver can choose to have either a blood or breath test. These tests are designed to determine the driver&#8217;s blood alcohol content (BAC). Readings of more than .08% will result in a driving under the influence (DUI) charge. Here&#8217;s what you need to know about a DUI blood test California.</p>
<h2><strong>Is a Blood Test Accurate?</strong></h2>
<p>A good <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/dui">DUI lawyer </a>will always raise concerns about DUI blood test accuracy. The readings received on these tests can vary from your actual blood alcohol level by between 4% and 10%. This means that even though the test says you were driving under the influence, your actual BAC may have been well below the legal limit.</p>
<p>External factors can also affect the accuracy of a DUI blood test. For example, if the skin is swabbed with ethyl alcohol by a technician before the sample is drawn, it could cause a falsely elevated reading.</p>
<h2><strong>What Are the Laws Associated With a DUI Blood Test?</strong></h2>
<p>A blood test to screen for DUI must be administered according to certain state regulations. The test must be performed by a licensed medical technician, properly combined with preservative and anti-coagulant solutions, labeled correctly and stored for at least one year.</p>
<h2><strong>What Should I Do if I Am Charged?</strong></h2>
<p>You have the right to seek independent lab testing of your BAC blood test results. These independent findings are admissible in court and may prove your innocence in a DUI case. The DUI blood test results time is usually about four to six weeks, so make sure to plan accordingly when it comes to your court date.</p>
<h2>Additional Information on DUI Testing</h2>
<p>When you drive in California, you have already consented to be tested for alcohol or drugs if you are under suspicion for driving under the influence. The most common tests are blood and breath tests, but in certain cases a urine sample may be taken.  If the DUI test resultsshow a BAC of more than .08%, and you have already taken a preliminary alcohol screening or a breath test, you could still be required to take a blood or urine test, if the officer believes you may be under the influence of the drugs. This is because the PAS or a breath test does not measure drug levels.</p>
<p>At this time, you do not have the right to request the presence of an attorney before completing a test, even though you might not understood what is a DUI blood test. Essentially, a sample of your blood is taken and then measured for the percentage of alcohol or drugs present.  Refusing to submit to a blood or urine test could result in your driving privileges being suspended.</p>
<h2>Facts on Penalties</h2>
<p>The penalties for a DUI conviction are severe. A first-time offense typically costs between $400-1,000 in fines. You could also face up to six months in jail, and your vehicle could be impounded and subject to storage fees. You will be required to complete a DUI driving program. Penalties for DUIs are progressive and increase if the BAC reaches certain thresholds and for repeated offenses.</p>
<h2>Information on Avoiding DUIs</h2>
<p>The best course of action is to not drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If you plan to be out drinking make sure to arrange a safe way home, such as calling a taxi or having a friend who is not drinking take the wheel. If you do get arrested, make sure to contact professional legal help. Learning how to avoid DUIconvictions will save you a lot of trouble and money.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been charged with a DUI in California after submitting to a blood test, you need the advice of an experienced <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/reckless-careless-driving">lawyer for reckless driving</a>. He or she can gather the necessary evidence to advocate on your behalf for lower penalties or even case dismissal.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a California driver, you may have heard that the California cell phone driving law prohibits texting or calling while driving.

<h3><strong>What Is California’s Cell Phone Law for Drivers?</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>In California, drivers may not use cell phones to call or text while driving with a few exceptions. Most relevant for the majority of situations is that using a hands-free cell phone system is allowed if the driver is 18 or older. The law defines a hands-free system as being one with the cellphone mounted on the windshield or dashboard and that the driver can activate or deactivate with a single swipe or tap.</p>
<p>Additionally, drivers may use a cell phone, even a handheld one, to make emergency calls to law enforcement or other emergency services. The California cell phone law only applies to drivers on public roads. If you are on private property, you can use a cell phone while driving.</p>
<h3><strong>What Are The Punishments?</strong></h3>
<p>The fine for breaking this law is $20 for the first violation and $50 for subsequent violations. However, you will likely pay more due to the addition of assessments. The total will likely be over $150 for the first offense and over $250 for subsequent offenses.</p>
