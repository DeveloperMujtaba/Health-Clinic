								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons you may have found yourself scheduled to appear in court, from getting a speeding ticket or failing to stop at a red light to DUI and reckless driving. If this is your first offense, here is some insight into a typical day in traffic court.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Your Day in Court</strong></h4>
<p>The first date that you will have the opportunity to present your case is called the arraignment. Arrive early to ensure you can find the courtroom and take a few minutes to prepare before the proceedings begin. Make sure you bring all documentation you need to present your case.</p>
<p>When the courtroom opens, you will be one among many individuals at the courthouse for the same or similar offenses. A clerk or bailiff may explain the rules and how the courtroom process works. After being sworn in, the judge will take the bench and begin calling cases.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Your Plea</strong></h4>
<p>When your name is called, you and your <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/accidents">accident ticket lawyer </a>will move to the podium to state your plea in front of the judge. You usually have two options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admit fault &#8211;</strong>This means you enter a “no contest” or a guilty plea. In most states, the judge has the authority to reduce the fine, which can make it worth spending the day in court.</li>
<li><strong>Plead not guilty –</strong>If you are fighting a speeding ticket, this is equivalent to requesting a trial. A date is set if the officer comes to court. If you don’t already have a traffic ticket attorney, you should consider retaining one.</li>
</ul>
