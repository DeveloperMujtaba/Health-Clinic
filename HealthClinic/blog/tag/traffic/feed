								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less traffic and open highways throughout California are contributing to an uptick in certain types of traffic tickets. Even with fewer people are travelling, law enforcement is working closely with Caltrans on safe transportation initiatives despite decreased driver presence on state roadways due to stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many drivers are taking advantage of less congested roads and are driving with a heavy foot. Speeding violations are on the rise as the California Office of Traffic Safety (COTS) has publicly urged drivers to slow down after seeing an 87% spike in related citations occurred recently.</p>
<h2>A Fast Growing Trend &#8211; Speeding More Than 100MPH</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/news/0OpdRJix/more-drivers-cited-for-speeding-as-traffic-declines">The California Highway Patrol (CHP)</a> reported a whopping 2,493 issuance of citations statewide that involved speeding more than 100 mph since March when stay-at-home guidelines went into effect. CHP says this is nearly double the number compared to the same time last year when 1,335 violations were issued. These shocking new numbers are even more eye-popping when you consider that traffic volume averages are down nearly 35% due to the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Caltrans, CHP, and the Office of Traffic Safety Join Forces</h2>
<p>In a joint effort to encourage motorists to reduce their speeds and be more careful behind the wheel, <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/news-releases/news-release-2020-014">Caltrans</a> teamed up with CHP and the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS). Outside of stepping up a law-enforcement presence on state roads and highways, electronic highway signs will also bear a safety-related message discouraging speeding and emphasizing traveling safely while driving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messages will also remind drivers of the Move Over Law that requires drivers to slow down or move over to a different lane if they see emergency vehicles, tow trucks, Caltrans, and other essential service providers.</p>
<h2>Consequences of Traffic Violations in California</h2>
<p>Despite most California <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/blog/traffic-ticket-case-coronavirus">traffic courts operating on limited availability</a> due to COVID-19 restrictions, those who commit infractions like speeding over 100 mph will receive a citation and be expected to take care of it online and possibly in-person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driving unsafely is taken seriously by California Highway Patrol, and if you get pulled over for this behavior, the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&amp;sectionNum=22348">California Vehicle Code</a> can hand out several punishments in response, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First offenses for speeding could bring fines starting at $238</li>
<li>One point on your driving record</li>
<li>Fines increase for habitual offenders</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, these are just base fines. The actual violation can increase penalties significantly. In cases of speeding at over 100 mph, the vehicle code has specific consequences, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Two points added to your driving record</li>
<li>A fine of up to $500 and a 30-day suspended license just for a first offense</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the second offense in three years, the fine and license suspension period goes up dramatically, even more so for third offenses in less than five years.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The State of California uses airplane units for a wide range of purposes. From surveillance to suspect apprehension to identifying hazardous road conditions, an eye from the sky is a vital part of efficient law enforcement practice. Although these airplane units have many beneficial uses, there are serious questions about their role in traffic enforcement, especially when investigating speeding tickets on a California highway. If you have been issued a speeding ticket based on airplane surveillance, an understanding of how this surveillance works and what mistakes are commonly made can go a long way in defending against the ticket in California traffic court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Air units are not used nearly as much as in the early 2000s when their primary function was traffic enforcement. Although the developments of radar have made it easier for ground units to enforce speed limits, there are still instances of air units&#8217; observations being the sole basis for a speeding ticket being issued. In preparing a defense to a speeding charge, our lawyers are prepared to address the following issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can GPS Speed Tracking Be Presented in Court?</h2>
<p>Air units have recently turned to the use of cameras installed on the belly of the plane that utilizes GPS to determine a vehicle’s speed and location. When the officer feels they have enough data to support a speeding ticket, they can radio an officer on the ground by giving them a vehicle description so that the ground officer can initiate a motor vehicle stop. Although this technology has, in years past, been ruled admissible in traffic court, this does not mean that GPS tracking is considered reliable on all occasions. Our experienced traffic ticket lawyers would attack on cross-examination, especially if the video quality has been compromised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Requiring Two Witnesses to Testify</h2>
<p>Another significant hurdle for law enforcement in sustaining a guilty finding in traffic court is the requirements that both officers involved in the observation and stop of the motor vehicle will be required to testify should the matter proceed to a trial. Live testimony can be difficult enough for one officer, let alone coordinating the schedule of two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the appearance of the officers, there is also the requirement that both testify consistently. The officers must identify not only the speed of the vehicle but also the vehicle’s identity. If each officer testifies as to different characteristics of a vehicle such as the color, make, or model, it will be difficult for a traffic court judge to find that the officers have presented sufficient evidence to support a conviction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Breaking The Chain of Testimony</h2>
<p>Even if the air and ground officers testify consistently about their observations, they still must testify accurately as to what information was relayed between the two to support the stop. A simple explanation of, &#8220;I received information&#8221; should be insufficient unless the officers can provide exact details as to when what and how the information was relayed. Even a slight break in the chain of data can be enough to argue that when the ground officer activated their lights, they did not have the reasonable suspicion that the vehicle they pulled over was the proper suspect in the speeding complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Challenging Technology</h2>
<p>Whether the air unit uses the old fashion, stopwatch, and grid approach, or if they have the luxury of the more sophisticated GPS tracking, the technology is only as good as the reliability of the technology and the reliability of the user of the technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are maintenance requirements for devices that are utilized to calculate speed, allowing a suspect to challenge the technology&#8217;s reliability if the officer cannot show that the maintenance procedure was followed before its use. Depending on the judge, it can be requested at a hearing that the officer produces sufficient maintenance records to support the device&#8217;s reliability. If they fail to do so, this could open the door for our lawyers to challenge that the officer has not shown clearly and convincingly that the speed reading they testified to is, in fact, accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California speeding tickets are serious matters that should be resolved immediately. Convictions for speeding can result in insurance increases and can put your driving privileges at risk of being revoked. Do not assume that simply because a law enforcement officer in the air says so, that you are, in fact, guilty of committing a speeding infraction. The lawyers at The Ticket Clinic are standing by to help you with any traffic violation. Call us for a free consultation.</p>

<h2>Updated 7/14/20: Los Angeles County Traffic Court</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 10, 2020 Los Angeles Superior Court Presiding Judge Kevin Brazile issued an order that all traffic courts will remain closed through at least August 8, 2020. Any cases set during this closure will be continued and court appearances will not be required. A notice from the court will be mailed and new court dates will be provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the courts may be closed, The Ticket Clinic is currently open for business. Our offices in Baldwin Park, Glendale, Huntington Park, Long Beach, Santa Ana and Studio City are open to the public.</span></p>
<div class="center bold header">
<p>TRAFFIC COURT CHANGES DURING THE CORONAVIRUS/COVID-19 EMERGENCY</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Court has provided immediate temporary relief for all traffic and non-traffic Infraction matters, including a 90-day extension on all due dates, including dates to pay, dates to appear in the Clerk&#8217;s Office, and dates to appear on tickets. If you have a hearing set before that date, please do not come to the courthouse as you will be turned away. You will receive in the mail a new date for your ticket to be heard after August 10.</p>
<p>If your California driver&#8217;s license is suspended due to unpaid traffic tickets, you can call the Court to set a future hearing date or establish a Payment Plan and have the Court request a release of the driver&#8217;s license hold from the DMV now. You should be aware that COVID-19 has affected the DMV&#8217;s ability to process these requests, so there may be some delays in having the holds lifted.</p>
<p>All court appearances previously scheduled for any time between March 17, 2020, and August 10, 2020, on a traffic infraction or a non-traffic infraction case have been rescheduled to a new date after August 10, 2020. If you did not receive notification of your new date, you may visit the court&#8217;s website at lacourt.org</p>
</div>
<h2>Update 3/30/20: California Traffic Courts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 23, 2020, and until further notice, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County closed the Clerk’s Offices at all 38 courthouses in response to the COVID-19 public health threat. Most courthouses, except the Beverly Hills and Catalina courthouses, will stay open for time-sensitive, essential court hearings and matters in accordance with Presiding Judge Kevin C. Brazile’s General Orders.</p>
<p>With Los Angeles traffic courts closed, citizens with a traffic ticket case in California will not be permitted to appear in court for an in-person hearing. Many traffic matters can be handled without an in-person court appearance, as many transactions can be handled online.</p>
<p>In accordance with the order of the Los Angeles court system and the Presiding Judge signed on March 18, 2020, all traffic-court hearings, including traffic infraction courts, scheduled between March 20, 2020, and April 16, 2020, will be continued for at least 30 days. This action is authorized under the General Order issued by Presiding Judge Brazile signed March 17 to close all courtrooms except to process cases presenting time-sensitive issues and essential functions. Traffic Infraction, Non-Traffic Infraction hearings, including trials, arraignments and other Infraction appearances, will receive updated Court notices by mail to individuals who have a court hearing scheduled within this time frame. These individuals will not be required to come to the courthouse. Instead, the mailed notice will provide a new court date.</p>
