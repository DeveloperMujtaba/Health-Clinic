								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst the Coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, the Judicial Council of California continues to carefully monitor the developing virus outbreak and situations surrounding it. Courts across the nation have been advised to follow the guidance provided by the Department of Public Health, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to slow the spread of the virus.

<h2>Updated 7/14/20: Los Angeles County Traffic Court</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 10, 2020 Los Angeles Superior Court Presiding Judge Kevin Brazile issued an order that all traffic courts will remain closed through at least August 8, 2020. Any cases set during this closure will be continued and court appearances will not be required. A notice from the court will be mailed and new court dates will be provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the courts may be closed, The Ticket Clinic is currently open for business. Our offices in Baldwin Park, Glendale, Huntington Park, Long Beach, Santa Ana and Studio City are open to the public.</span></p>
<div class="center bold header">
<p>TRAFFIC COURT CHANGES DURING THE CORONAVIRUS/COVID-19 EMERGENCY</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Court has provided immediate temporary relief for all traffic and non-traffic Infraction matters, including a 90-day extension on all due dates, including dates to pay, dates to appear in the Clerk&#8217;s Office, and dates to appear on tickets. If you have a hearing set before that date, please do not come to the courthouse as you will be turned away. You will receive in the mail a new date for your ticket to be heard after August 10.</p>
<p>If your California driver&#8217;s license is suspended due to unpaid traffic tickets, you can call the Court to set a future hearing date or establish a Payment Plan and have the Court request a release of the driver&#8217;s license hold from the DMV now. You should be aware that COVID-19 has affected the DMV&#8217;s ability to process these requests, so there may be some delays in having the holds lifted.</p>
<p>All court appearances previously scheduled for any time between March 17, 2020, and August 10, 2020, on a traffic infraction or a non-traffic infraction case have been rescheduled to a new date after August 10, 2020. If you did not receive notification of your new date, you may visit the court&#8217;s website at lacourt.org</p>
</div>
<h2>Update 3/30/20: California Traffic Courts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 23, 2020, and until further notice, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County closed the Clerk’s Offices at all 38 courthouses in response to the COVID-19 public health threat. Most courthouses, except the Beverly Hills and Catalina courthouses, will stay open for time-sensitive, essential court hearings and matters in accordance with Presiding Judge Kevin C. Brazile’s General Orders.</p>
<p>With Los Angeles traffic courts closed, citizens with a traffic ticket case in California will not be permitted to appear in court for an in-person hearing. Many traffic matters can be handled without an in-person court appearance, as many transactions can be handled online.</p>
<p>In accordance with the order of the Los Angeles court system and the Presiding Judge signed on March 18, 2020, all traffic-court hearings, including traffic infraction courts, scheduled between March 20, 2020, and April 16, 2020, will be continued for at least 30 days. This action is authorized under the General Order issued by Presiding Judge Brazile signed March 17 to close all courtrooms except to process cases presenting time-sensitive issues and essential functions. Traffic Infraction, Non-Traffic Infraction hearings, including trials, arraignments and other Infraction appearances, will receive updated Court notices by mail to individuals who have a court hearing scheduled within this time frame. These individuals will not be required to come to the courthouse. Instead, the mailed notice will provide a new court date.</p>
