								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less traffic and open highways throughout California are contributing to an uptick in certain types of traffic tickets. Even with fewer people are travelling, law enforcement is working closely with Caltrans on safe transportation initiatives despite decreased driver presence on state roadways due to stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many drivers are taking advantage of less congested roads and are driving with a heavy foot. Speeding violations are on the rise as the California Office of Traffic Safety (COTS) has publicly urged drivers to slow down after seeing an 87% spike in related citations occurred recently.</p>
<h2>A Fast Growing Trend &#8211; Speeding More Than 100MPH</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/news/0OpdRJix/more-drivers-cited-for-speeding-as-traffic-declines">The California Highway Patrol (CHP)</a> reported a whopping 2,493 issuance of citations statewide that involved speeding more than 100 mph since March when stay-at-home guidelines went into effect. CHP says this is nearly double the number compared to the same time last year when 1,335 violations were issued. These shocking new numbers are even more eye-popping when you consider that traffic volume averages are down nearly 35% due to the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Caltrans, CHP, and the Office of Traffic Safety Join Forces</h2>
<p>In a joint effort to encourage motorists to reduce their speeds and be more careful behind the wheel, <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/news-releases/news-release-2020-014">Caltrans</a> teamed up with CHP and the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS). Outside of stepping up a law-enforcement presence on state roads and highways, electronic highway signs will also bear a safety-related message discouraging speeding and emphasizing traveling safely while driving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messages will also remind drivers of the Move Over Law that requires drivers to slow down or move over to a different lane if they see emergency vehicles, tow trucks, Caltrans, and other essential service providers.</p>
<h2>Consequences of Traffic Violations in California</h2>
<p>Despite most California <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/blog/traffic-ticket-case-coronavirus">traffic courts operating on limited availability</a> due to COVID-19 restrictions, those who commit infractions like speeding over 100 mph will receive a citation and be expected to take care of it online and possibly in-person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driving unsafely is taken seriously by California Highway Patrol, and if you get pulled over for this behavior, the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&amp;sectionNum=22348">California Vehicle Code</a> can hand out several punishments in response, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First offenses for speeding could bring fines starting at $238</li>
<li>One point on your driving record</li>
<li>Fines increase for habitual offenders</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, these are just base fines. The actual violation can increase penalties significantly. In cases of speeding at over 100 mph, the vehicle code has specific consequences, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Two points added to your driving record</li>
<li>A fine of up to $500 and a 30-day suspended license just for a first offense</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the second offense in three years, the fine and license suspension period goes up dramatically, even more so for third offenses in less than five years.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The State of California uses airplane units for a wide range of purposes. From surveillance to suspect apprehension to identifying hazardous road conditions, an eye from the sky is a vital part of efficient law enforcement practice. Although these airplane units have many beneficial uses, there are serious questions about their role in traffic enforcement, especially when investigating speeding tickets on a California highway. If you have been issued a speeding ticket based on airplane surveillance, an understanding of how this surveillance works and what mistakes are commonly made can go a long way in defending against the ticket in California traffic court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Air units are not used nearly as much as in the early 2000s when their primary function was traffic enforcement. Although the developments of radar have made it easier for ground units to enforce speed limits, there are still instances of air units&#8217; observations being the sole basis for a speeding ticket being issued. In preparing a defense to a speeding charge, our lawyers are prepared to address the following issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can GPS Speed Tracking Be Presented in Court?</h2>
<p>Air units have recently turned to the use of cameras installed on the belly of the plane that utilizes GPS to determine a vehicle’s speed and location. When the officer feels they have enough data to support a speeding ticket, they can radio an officer on the ground by giving them a vehicle description so that the ground officer can initiate a motor vehicle stop. Although this technology has, in years past, been ruled admissible in traffic court, this does not mean that GPS tracking is considered reliable on all occasions. Our experienced traffic ticket lawyers would attack on cross-examination, especially if the video quality has been compromised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Requiring Two Witnesses to Testify</h2>
<p>Another significant hurdle for law enforcement in sustaining a guilty finding in traffic court is the requirements that both officers involved in the observation and stop of the motor vehicle will be required to testify should the matter proceed to a trial. Live testimony can be difficult enough for one officer, let alone coordinating the schedule of two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the appearance of the officers, there is also the requirement that both testify consistently. The officers must identify not only the speed of the vehicle but also the vehicle’s identity. If each officer testifies as to different characteristics of a vehicle such as the color, make, or model, it will be difficult for a traffic court judge to find that the officers have presented sufficient evidence to support a conviction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Breaking The Chain of Testimony</h2>
<p>Even if the air and ground officers testify consistently about their observations, they still must testify accurately as to what information was relayed between the two to support the stop. A simple explanation of, &#8220;I received information&#8221; should be insufficient unless the officers can provide exact details as to when what and how the information was relayed. Even a slight break in the chain of data can be enough to argue that when the ground officer activated their lights, they did not have the reasonable suspicion that the vehicle they pulled over was the proper suspect in the speeding complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Challenging Technology</h2>
<p>Whether the air unit uses the old fashion, stopwatch, and grid approach, or if they have the luxury of the more sophisticated GPS tracking, the technology is only as good as the reliability of the technology and the reliability of the user of the technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are maintenance requirements for devices that are utilized to calculate speed, allowing a suspect to challenge the technology&#8217;s reliability if the officer cannot show that the maintenance procedure was followed before its use. Depending on the judge, it can be requested at a hearing that the officer produces sufficient maintenance records to support the device&#8217;s reliability. If they fail to do so, this could open the door for our lawyers to challenge that the officer has not shown clearly and convincingly that the speed reading they testified to is, in fact, accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California speeding tickets are serious matters that should be resolved immediately. Convictions for speeding can result in insurance increases and can put your driving privileges at risk of being revoked. Do not assume that simply because a law enforcement officer in the air says so, that you are, in fact, guilty of committing a speeding infraction. The lawyers at The Ticket Clinic are standing by to help you with any traffic violation. Call us for a free consultation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In general, a police speed trap is any technique used by police to catch speeders with the primary intent of raising revenue through issuing tickets. When police enforce speed limits to ensure safety, it is not a speed trap. However, enforcement isn’t always so genuinely motivated. If the goal is to issue tickets to meet quotas and charge fees, then it is a speed trap.</p>
<p>Depending on the tactic used, speed traps may be illegal in California. However, many strategies are completely legal. Additionally, even with prohibited techniques, you may need a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyer </a>to help you challenge the ticket.</p>
<h4><strong>When Speed Traps Are Illegal in California</strong></h4>
<p>The above begs the questions: when are speed traps legal and when aren’t they? The traps prohibited under California’s speed trapping laws are “marked road traps” and “unjustified speed limit traps.”</p>
<p>The former of these prohibited police speed trap techniques is a section of road that has been marked for measuring the speed of a vehicle by calculating travel time. In other words, it is a method of catching speeders by seeing if they travel between two points more quickly than legally should be able to.</p>
<p>The second of these tactics is a section of road that has an unjustified drop in the speed limit. This technique causes people to speed if they don’t notice a change in the speed limit without any change in the road conditions that would justify a lower speed.</p>
<h4><strong>Challenging Speed Trap Tickets</strong></h4>
<p>If you receive a speeding ticket as the result of a speed trap you can challenge it in California. Even if it was not issued due to one of the above-mentioned techniques, you may still be able to get it thrown out or reduced.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California drivers as well as those who are just passing through should be aware of the state&#8217;s four major speed laws. If you run into trouble and receive an expensive fine or points on your license, <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyers </a>can advocate on your behalf. Here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>
<h4><strong>Basic Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>According to the California basic speed law, drivers cannot exceed a safe speed for the current road and weather conditions. Even when you are adhering to the posted speed limit, you can get a ticket if the officer determines you are driving too fast for the number of cars on the road, the road surface, the general flow of traffic, the weather and/or the presence of cyclists or pedestrians.</p>
<h4><strong>Maximum Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>This law prohibits drivers from exceeding a posted speed limit. On most California highways, the maximum speed is 65 miles per hour though some roads allow a speed of up to 70 mph. For a two-lane highway with no dividers, 55 mph is the maximum speed limit unless otherwise posted.</p>
<h4><strong>Minimum Speed Law</strong></h4>
<p>The minimum speed law says that drivers can be cited for driving too slow if they are interrupting the flow of traffic. In addition, some roads have a posted minimum speed limit.</p>
<h4><strong>Prima Facie Speed Limit</strong></h4>
<p>This California law establishes maximum speed limits that must be observed in areas where no speed limit is posted. Prima facie speed limits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>25 miles per hour in school zones, residential areas and business districts</li>
<li>15 miles per hour in alleys, railroad crossings and highway intersections with less than 100 feet of visibility</li>
</ul>
<p>A first-time speeding offense carries a fine of up to $100 depending on the circumstances of your case. If you were driving faster than 100 mph, you could receive a six-month license suspension and a $500 fine. Subsequent offenses carry higher fine and even jail time. If you&#8217;ve been charged with breaking any of these four speed limit laws, a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/accidents">driving accident lawyer </a>can fight for you in court.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons you may have found yourself scheduled to appear in court, from getting a speeding ticket or failing to stop at a red light to DUI and reckless driving. If this is your first offense, here is some insight into a typical day in traffic court.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Your Day in Court</strong></h4>
<p>The first date that you will have the opportunity to present your case is called the arraignment. Arrive early to ensure you can find the courtroom and take a few minutes to prepare before the proceedings begin. Make sure you bring all documentation you need to present your case.</p>
<p>When the courtroom opens, you will be one among many individuals at the courthouse for the same or similar offenses. A clerk or bailiff may explain the rules and how the courtroom process works. After being sworn in, the judge will take the bench and begin calling cases.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Your Plea</strong></h4>
<p>When your name is called, you and your <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/accidents">accident ticket lawyer </a>will move to the podium to state your plea in front of the judge. You usually have two options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admit fault &#8211;</strong>This means you enter a “no contest” or a guilty plea. In most states, the judge has the authority to reduce the fine, which can make it worth spending the day in court.</li>
<li><strong>Plead not guilty –</strong>If you are fighting a speeding ticket, this is equivalent to requesting a trial. A date is set if the officer comes to court. If you don’t already have a traffic ticket attorney, you should consider retaining one.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Contact Us Today</strong></h4>
<p>Engaging a <a href="https://www.ticketclinic.com/services/speeding-ticket-lawyer">speeding ticket lawyer </a>can help you fight the ticket if it was the result of a speed trap, even if the officer had a radar gun.
